  <p>In hip hop, so much can be explained by the rise and fall of record labels.</p>

  <p>Lil Wayne's ascent is the story of Cash Money. The Dirty South starts with LaFace Records. The east-coast/west-coast feud is Bad Boy vs. Death Row. In hip hop, the artist-label relationship isn't just a business deal, but a commitment to an identity.</p>

  <p>We wanted to surface the notable labels in hip hop's history, so we measured every label by its artists' chart performance on Billboard (collaborating with of Rhymesayers to call out insights). By highlighting the labels who produced the most hits at any given time, we'd understand who was wielding enormous influence on hip hop's sound, distribution, and direction.</p>
