      "The technological singularity—or simply the singularity[1]—is a hypothetical future point in time at which technological growth becomes uncontrollable and irreversible, resulting in unforeseeable changes to human civilization.[2][3] According to the most popular version of the singularity hypothesis, I. J. Good's intelligence explosion model, an upgradable intelligent agent will eventually enter a \"runaway reaction\" of self-improvement cycles, each new and more intelligent generation appearing more and more rapidly, causing an \"explosion\" in intelligence and resulting in a powerful superintelligence that qualitatively far surpasses all human intelligence.[4]\n",
      "\n",
      "The first person to use the concept of a \"singularity\" in the technological context was the 20th-century Hungarian-American mathematician John von Neumann.[5] Stanislaw Ulam reports in 1958 an earlier discussion with von Neumann \"centered on the accelerating progress of technology and changes in the mode of human life, which gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue\".[6] Subsequent authors have echoed this viewpoint.[3][7]\n",
      "\n",
      "The concept and the term \"singularity\" were popularized by Vernor Vinge first in 1983 in an article that claimed that once humans create intelligences greater than their own, there will be a technological and social transition similar in some sense to \"the knotted space-time at the center of a black hole\",[8] and later in his 1993 essay The Coming Technological Singularity,[4][7] in which he wrote that it would signal the end of the human era, as the new superintelligence would continue to upgrade itself and would advance technologically at an incomprehensible rate. He wrote that he would be surprised if it occurred before 2005 or after 2030.[4] Another significant contributor to wider circulation of the notion was Ray Kurzweil's 2005 book The Singularity Is Near, predicting singularity by 2045.[7]\n",
      "\n",
      "Some scientists, including Stephen Hawking, have expressed concern that artificial superintelligence (ASI) could result in human extinction.[9][10] The consequences of the singularity and its potential benefit or harm to the human race have been intensely debated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prominent technologists and academics dispute the plausibility of a technological singularity and the associated artificial intelligence explosion, including Paul Allen,[11] Jeff Hawkins,[12] John Holland, Jaron Lanier, Steven Pinker,[12] Theodore Modis,[13] and Gordon Moore.[12] One claim made was that the artificial intelligence growth is likely to run into decreasing returns instead of accelerating ones, as was observed in previously developed human technologies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although technological progress has been accelerating in most areas, it has been limited by the basic intelligence of the human brain, which has not, according to Paul R. Ehrlich, changed significantly for millennia.[14] However, with the increasing power of computers and other technologies, it might eventually be possible to build a machine that is significantly more intelligent than humans.[15]\n",
      "\n",
      "If a superhuman intelligence were to be invented—either through the amplification of human intelligence or through artificial intelligence—it would vastly improve over human problem-solving and inventive skills. Such an AI is referred to as Seed AI[16][17] because if an AI were created with engineering capabilities that matched or surpassed those of its human creators, it would have the potential to autonomously improve its own software and hardware to design an even more capable machine, which could repeat the process in turn. This recursive self-improvement could accelerate, potentially allowing enormous qualitative change before any upper limits imposed by the laws of physics or theoretical computation set in. It is speculated that over many iterations, such an AI would far surpass human cognitive abilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "I. J. Good speculated in 1965 that superhuman intelligence might bring about an intelligence explosion:[18][19]\n",
      "\n",
      "Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever. Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an 'intelligence explosion', and the intelligence of man would be left far behind. Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make, provided that the machine is docile enough to tell us how to keep it under control.\n",
      "One version of intelligence explosion is where computing power approaches infinity in a finite amount of time. In this version, once AIs are doing the research to improve themselves, speed doubles e.g. after 2 years, then 1 year, then 6 months, then 3 months, then 1.5 months, etc., where the infinite sum of the doubling periods is 4 years. Unless prevented by physical limits of computation and time quantization, this process would literally achieve infinite computing power in 4 years, properly earning the name \"singularity\" for the final state. This form of intelligence explosion is described in Yudkowsky (1996).[20]\n",
      "\n",
      "A superintelligence, hyperintelligence, or superhuman intelligence is a hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human minds. \"Superintelligence\" may also refer to the form or degree of intelligence possessed by such an agent. John von Neumann, Vernor Vinge and Ray Kurzweil define the concept in terms of the technological creation of super intelligence, arguing that it is difficult or impossible for present-day humans to predict what human beings' lives would be like in a post-singularity world.[4][21]\n",
      "\n",
      "The related concept \"speed superintelligence\" describes an AI that can function like a human mind, only much faster.[22] For example, with a million-fold increase in the speed of information processing relative to that of humans, a subjective year would pass in 30 physical seconds.[23] Such a difference in information processing speed could drive the singularity.[24]\n",
      "\n",
      "Technology forecasters and researchers disagree regarding when, or whether, human intelligence will likely be surpassed. Some argue that advances in artificial intelligence (AI) will probably result in general reasoning systems that bypass human cognitive limitations. Others believe that humans will evolve or directly modify their biology so as to achieve radically greater intelligence.[25][26] A number of futures studies focus on scenarios that combine these possibilities, suggesting that humans are likely to interface with computers, or upload their minds to computers, in a way that enables substantial intelligence amplification. The book The Age of Em by Robin Hanson describes a hypothetical future scenario in which human brains are scanned and digitized, creating \"uploads\" or digital versions of human consciousness. In this future, the development of these uploads may precede or coincide with the emergence of superintelligent artificial intelligence.[27]\n",
      "\n",
      "Some writers use \"the singularity\" in a broader way to refer to any radical changes in society brought about by new technology (such as molecular nanotechnology),[28][29][30] although Vinge and other writers specifically state that without superintelligence, such changes would not qualify as a true singularity.[4]\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1965 I. J. Good predicted an ultraintelligent machine by 2000,[18] Vinge (1993) predicted greater-than-human intelligence between 2005 and 2030,[4] Yudkowsky (1996) predicted a singularity by 2021,[20] and Kurzweil (2005) predicted human-level artificial intelligence by 2030.[7] Moravec (1988) predicted human-level artificial intelligence in supercomputers by 2010 by extrapolating past trend using a chart,[31] while Moravec (1998/1999) predicted human-level artificial intelligence by 2040, and intelligence far beyond human by 2050.[32] In a 2017 interview, Kurzweil predicted human-level intelligence by 2029 and billion fold intelligence and singularity by 2045.[33][34]\n",
      "\n",
      "Four polls of AI researchers, conducted in 2012 and 2013 by Nick Bostrom and Vincent C. Müller, suggested a confidence of 50% that human-level AI would be developed by 2040–2050.[35][36]\n",
      "\n",
      "Prominent technologists and academics dispute the plausibility of a technological singularity, including Paul Allen,[11] Jeff Hawkins,[12] John Holland, Jaron Lanier, Steven Pinker,[12] Theodore Modis,[13] and Gordon Moore,[12] whose law is often cited in support of the concept.[37]\n",
      "\n",
      "Most proposed methods for creating superhuman or transhuman minds fall into one of two categories: intelligence amplification of human brains and artificial intelligence. The many speculated ways to augment human intelligence include bioengineering, genetic engineering, nootropic drugs, AI assistants, direct brain–computer interfaces and mind uploading. These multiple possible paths to an intelligence explosion, all of which will presumably be pursued, makes a singularity more likely.[23]\n",
      "\n",
      "Robin Hanson expressed skepticism of human intelligence augmentation, writing that once the \"low-hanging fruit\" of easy methods for increasing human intelligence have been exhausted, further improvements will become increasingly difficult.[38] Despite all of the speculated ways for amplifying human intelligence, non-human artificial intelligence (specifically seed AI) is the most popular option among the hypotheses that would advance the singularity.[citation needed]\n",
      "\n",
      "The possibility of an intelligence explosion depends on three factors.[39] The first accelerating factor is the new intelligence enhancements made possible by each previous improvement. Contrariwise, as the intelligences become more advanced, further advances will become more and more complicated, possibly outweighing the advantage of increased intelligence. Each improvement should generate at least one more improvement, on average, for movement towards singularity to continue. Finally, the laws of physics may eventually prevent further improvement.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are two logically independent, but mutually reinforcing, causes of intelligence improvements: increases in the speed of computation, and improvements to the algorithms used.[7] The former is predicted by Moore's Law and the forecasted improvements in hardware,[40] and is comparatively similar to previous technological advances. But there are some AI researchers,[who?] who believe software is more important than hardware.[41]\n",
      "\n",
      "A 2017 email survey of authors with publications at the 2015 NeurIPS and ICML machine learning conferences asked about the chance that \"the intelligence explosion argument is broadly correct\". Of the respondents, 12% said it was \"quite likely\", 17% said it was \"likely\", 21% said it was \"about even\", 24% said it was \"unlikely\" and 26% said it was \"quite unlikely\".[42]\n",
      "\n",
      "Both for human and artificial intelligence, hardware improvements increase the rate of future hardware improvements. An analogy to Moore's Law suggests that if the first doubling of speed took 18 months, the second would take 18 subjective months; or 9 external months, whereafter, four months, two months, and so on towards a speed singularity.[43][20] Some upper limit on speed may eventually be reached. Jeff Hawkins has stated that a self-improving computer system would inevitably run into upper limits on computing power: \"in the end there are limits to how big and fast computers can run. We would end up in the same place; we'd just get there a bit faster. There would be no singularity.\"[12]\n",
      "\n",
      "It is difficult to directly compare silicon-based hardware with neurons. But Berglas (2008) notes that computer speech recognition is approaching human capabilities, and that this capability seems to require 0.01% of the volume of the brain. This analogy suggests that modern computer hardware is within a few orders of magnitude of being as powerful as the human brain.\n",
      "\n",
      "The exponential growth in computing technology suggested by Moore's law is commonly cited as a reason to expect a singularity in the relatively near future, and a number of authors have proposed generalizations of Moore's law. Computer scientist and futurist Hans Moravec proposed in a 1998 book[44] that the exponential growth curve could be extended back through earlier computing technologies prior to the integrated circuit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ray Kurzweil postulates a law of accelerating returns in which the speed of technological change (and more generally, all evolutionary processes[45]) increases exponentially, generalizing Moore's law in the same manner as Moravec's proposal, and also including material technology (especially as applied to nanotechnology), medical technology and others.[46] Between 1986 and 2007, machines' application-specific capacity to compute information per capita roughly doubled every 14 months; the per capita capacity of the world's general-purpose computers has doubled every 18 months; the global telecommunication capacity per capita doubled every 34 months; and the world's storage capacity per capita doubled every 40 months.[47] On the other hand, it has been argued that the global acceleration pattern having the 21st century singularity as its parameter should be characterized as hyperbolic rather than exponential.[48]\n",
      "\n",
      "Kurzweil reserves the term \"singularity\" for a rapid increase in artificial intelligence (as opposed to other technologies), writing for example that \"The Singularity will allow us to transcend these limitations of our biological bodies and brains ... There will be no distinction, post-Singularity, between human and machine\".[49] He also defines his predicted date of the singularity (2045) in terms of when he expects computer-based intelligences to significantly exceed the sum total of human brainpower, writing that advances in computing before that date \"will not represent the Singularity\" because they do \"not yet correspond to a profound expansion of our intelligence.\"[50]\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Some singularity proponents argue its inevitability through extrapolation of past trends, especially those pertaining to shortening gaps between improvements to technology. In one of the first uses of the term \"singularity\" in the context of technological progress, Stanislaw Ulam tells of a conversation with John von Neumann about accelerating change: \n",
      "One conversation centered on the ever accelerating progress of technology and changes in the mode of human life, which gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue.[6]\n",
      "Kurzweil claims that technological progress follows a pattern of exponential growth, following what he calls the \"law of accelerating returns\". Whenever technology approaches a barrier, Kurzweil writes, new technologies will surmount it. He predicts paradigm shifts will become increasingly common, leading to \"technological change so rapid and profound it represents a rupture in the fabric of human history\".[51] Kurzweil believes that the singularity will occur by approximately 2045.[46] His predictions differ from Vinge's in that he predicts a gradual ascent to the singularity, rather than Vinge's rapidly self-improving superhuman intelligence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oft-cited dangers include those commonly associated with molecular nanotechnology and genetic engineering. These threats are major issues for both singularity advocates and critics, and were the subject of Bill Joy's April 2000 Wired magazine article \"Why The Future Doesn't Need Us\".[7][52]\n",
      "\n",
      "Some intelligence technologies, like \"seed AI\",[16][17] may also have the potential to not just make themselves faster, but also more efficient, by modifying their source code. These improvements would make further improvements possible, which would make further improvements possible, and so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mechanism for a recursively self-improving set of algorithms differs from an increase in raw computation speed in two ways. First, it does not require external influence: machines designing faster hardware would still require humans to create the improved hardware, or to program factories appropriately.[citation needed] An AI rewriting its own source code could do so while contained in an AI box.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, as with Vernor Vinge's conception of the singularity, it is much harder to predict the outcome. While speed increases seem to be only a quantitative difference from human intelligence, actual algorithm improvements would be qualitatively different. Eliezer Yudkowsky compares it to the changes that human intelligence brought: humans changed the world thousands of times more rapidly than evolution had done, and in totally different ways. Similarly, the evolution of life was a massive departure and acceleration from the previous geological rates of change, and improved intelligence could cause change to be as different again.[53]\n",
      "\n",
      "There are substantial dangers associated with an intelligence explosion singularity originating from a recursively self-improving set of algorithms. First, the goal structure of the AI might self-modify, potentially causing the AI to optimise for something other than what was originally intended.[54][55]\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, AIs could compete for the same scarce resources humankind uses to survive.[56][57] While not actively malicious, AIs would promote the goals of their programming, not necessarily broader human goals, and thus might crowd out humans completely.[58][59][60]\n",
      "\n",
      "Carl Shulman and Anders Sandberg suggest that algorithm improvements may be the limiting factor for a singularity; while hardware efficiency tends to improve at a steady pace, software innovations are more unpredictable and may be bottlenecked by serial, cumulative research. They suggest that in the case of a software-limited singularity, intelligence explosion would actually become more likely than with a hardware-limited singularity, because in the software-limited case, once human-level AI is developed, it could run serially on very fast hardware, and the abundance of cheap hardware would make AI research less constrained.[61] An abundance of accumulated hardware that can be unleashed once the software figures out how to use it has been called \"computing overhang\".[62]\n",
      "\n",
      "Some critics, like philosopher Hubert Dreyfus[63] and philosopher John Searle,[64] assert that computers or machines cannot achieve human intelligence. Others, like physicist Stephen Hawking,[65] object that whether machines can achieve a true intelligence or merely something similar to intelligence is irrelevant if the net result is the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "Psychologist Steven Pinker stated in 2008: \"There is not the slightest reason to believe in a coming singularity. The fact that you can visualize a future in your imagination is not evidence that it is likely or even possible. Look at domed cities, jet-pack commuting, underwater cities, mile-high buildings, and nuclear-powered automobiles—all staples of futuristic fantasies when I was a child that have never arrived. Sheer processing power is not a pixie dust that magically solves all your problems. ...\"[12]\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin Ford[66] postulates a \"technology paradox\" in that before the singularity could occur most routine jobs in the economy would be automated, since this would require a level of technology inferior to that of the singularity. This would cause massive unemployment and plummeting consumer demand, which in turn would destroy the incentive to invest in the technologies that would be required to bring about the Singularity. Job displacement is increasingly no longer limited to those types of work traditionally considered to be \"routine\".[67]\n",
      "\n",
      "Theodore Modis[68] and Jonathan Huebner[69] argue that the rate of technological innovation has not only ceased to rise, but is actually now declining. Evidence for this decline is that the rise in computer clock rates is slowing, even while Moore's prediction of exponentially increasing circuit density continues to hold. This is due to excessive heat build-up from the chip, which cannot be dissipated quickly enough to prevent the chip from melting when operating at higher speeds. Advances in speed may be possible in the future by virtue of more power-efficient CPU designs and multi-cell processors.[70]\n",
      "\n",
      "Theodore Modis holds the singularity cannot happen.[71][13][72] He claims the \"technological singularity\" and especially Kurzweil lack scientific rigor; Kurzweil is alleged to mistake the logistic function (S-function) for an exponential function, and to see a \"knee\" in an exponential function where there can in fact be no such thing.[73] In a 2021 article, Modis pointed out that no milestones – breaks in historical perspective comparable in importance to the Internet, DNA, the transistor, or nuclear energy – had been observed in the previous twenty years while five of them would have been expected according to the exponential trend advocated by the proponents of the technological singularity.[74]\n",
      "\n",
      "AI researcher Jürgen Schmidhuber stated that the frequency of subjectively \"notable events\" appears to be approaching a 21st-century singularity, but cautioned readers to take such plots of subjective events with a grain of salt: perhaps differences in memory of recent and distant events could create an illusion of accelerating change where none exists.[75]\n",
      "\n",
      "Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen argued the opposite of accelerating returns, the complexity brake;[11] the more progress science makes towards understanding intelligence, the more difficult it becomes to make additional progress. A study of the number of patents shows that human creativity does not show accelerating returns, but in fact, as suggested by Joseph Tainter in his The Collapse of Complex Societies,[76] a law of diminishing returns. The number of patents per thousand peaked in the period from 1850 to 1900, and has been declining since.[69] The growth of complexity eventually becomes self-limiting, and leads to a widespread \"general systems collapse\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Hofstadter (2006) raises concern that Ray Kurzweil is not sufficiently scientifically rigorous, that an exponential tendency of technology is not a scientific law like one of physics, and that exponential curves have no \"knees\".[77] Nonetheless, he did not rule out the singularity in principle in the distant future[12] and in the light of ChatGPT and other recent advancements has revised his opinion significantly towards dramatic technological change in the near future.[78]\n",
      "\n",

      "In addition to general criticisms of the singularity concept, several critics have raised issues with Kurzweil's iconic chart. One line of criticism is that a log-log chart of this nature is inherently biased toward a straight-line result. Others identify selection bias in the points that Kurzweil chooses to use. For example, biologist PZ Myers points out that many of the early evolutionary \"events\" were picked arbitrarily.[82] Kurzweil has rebutted this by charting evolutionary events from 15 neutral sources, and showing that they fit a straight line on a log-log chart. Kelly (2006) argues that the way the Kurzweil chart is constructed with x-axis having time before present, it always points to the singularity being \"now\", for any date on which one would construct such a chart, and shows this visually on Kurzweil's chart.[83]\n",

In the current era, beginning with the Industrial Revolution, the world's economic output doubles every fifteen years, sixty times faster than during the agricultural era.

While both require large advances in recursive optimisation process design, friendly AI also requires the ability to make goal structures invariant under self-improvement (or the AI could transform itself into something unfriendly) and a goal structure that aligns with human values and does not automatically destroy the human race. An unfriendly AI, on the other hand, can optimize for an arbitrary goal structure, which does not need to be invariant under self-modification.[99] Bill Hibbard (2014) harvtxt error: no target: CITEREFBill_Hibbard2014 (help) proposes an AI design that avoids several dangers including self-delusion,[100] unintended instrumental actions,[54][101] and corruption of the reward generator.[101] He also discusses social impacts of AI[102] and testing AI.[103] His 2001 book Super-Intelligent Machines advocates the need for public education about AI and public control over AI.

Hall suggests that rather than recursively self-improving its hardware, software, and infrastructure all on its own, a fledgling AI would be better off specializing in one area where it was most effective and then buying the remaining components on the marketplace, because the quality of products on the marketplace continually improves, and the AI would have a hard time keeping up with the cutting-edge technology used by the rest of the world.[113]\n",

More further argues that a superintelligence would not transform the world overnight: a superintelligence would need to engage with existing, slow human systems to accomplish physical impacts on the world. \"The need for collaboration, for organization, and for putting ideas into physical changes will ensure that all the old rules are not thrown out overnight or even within years.\"[115]\n",

The machines are expected to reach human level and then improve themselves beyond that (\"Most significantly of all, they [the machines] can be put to work as programmers and engineers, with the task of optimizing the software and hardware which make them what they are. The successive generations of machines produced this way will be increasingly smarter and more cost effective.\") Humans will no longer be needed, and their abilities will be overtaken by the machines: \"In the long run the sheer physical inability of humans to keep up with these rapidly evolving progeny of our minds will ensure that the ratio of people to machines approaches zero, and that a direct descendant of our culture, but not our genes, inherits the universe.\" While the word \"singularity\" is not used, the notion of human-level thinking machines thereafter improving themselves beyond human level is there.
